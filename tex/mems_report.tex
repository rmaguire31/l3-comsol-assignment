        This report describes how the $C$--$T$ characteristics of \mems
        multimorph capacitive temperature sensors vary with geometry,     
        material choice and prestress conditions. The sensors were modelled
        using \fem and physics simulation software---\ComsolMultiphysics---so
        the key design parameters, physics modelling choices and mesh analysis
        are also included.

\section{Introduction}

In an increasingly data centric world, the number of sensors found in
consumer electronics, industrial health monitoring, the automotive industry and
other sectors is expected exceed one trillion in the next 20
years~\cite{bryzek2014emergence}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{J. Bryzek's trillion sensor vision~\cite{bryzek2014emergence}.}
    \label{fig:tsensors}
\end{figure}

Temperature sensors make up an sizeable portion of this industry: the demand for
smaller, more efficient and more accurate sensors is rising. There are a few
existing temperature sensors available across different sectors.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Thermistors: which exhibit a non-linear inverted resistive response
    across a wide range of temperatures.
    \item Thermocouples: which generate a non-linear potential difference
    response to across two dissimilar conductors due to a thermoelectric effect.
    \item Resistance thermometers (\rtd{}s): which respond with a very linear
    resistance for some materials: \ce{Pt}, \ce{Cu} and \ce{Ni}.
    \item Silicon bandgap sensors: which respond in conductivity at scales
    suitable for \ic{}s.
\end{itemize}

Multimorph capacitive sensors are an alternative investigated by Scott in his
2012 paper~\cite{scott2012600}. Unlike resistive temperature sensors,
capacitive sensors do not consume power at constant temperature. Low power
consumption combined with small \mems package size means there is opportunity
for these sensors to dominate in portable devices moving forward.

\section{Background}

A multimorph is a cantilever composed of layers of with increasing expansion
coefficients. When current travels in opposite directions through
two piezo-electric multimorphs layers, the layers are subjected to different
stresses and the cantilever deflects. This is an actuator.

Temperature responsive multimorphs are composed of layers with increasing
thermal expansion coefficients. When the multimorph cantilever is heated, it's
temperature increases, the layers expand by differing amounts and the cantilever
deflects. This deflection can be sensed through changing capacitance.

    \label{fig:multimorph}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Construction}

An effective temperature sensitive multimorph has layers with increasing thermal
expansion coefficients. Scott uses a three layer multimorph with  thermally
grown \ce{SiO2}, vapour deposited \ce{Si3N4}, sputtered \ce{Au}.
Table~\ref{tab:cmos-materials} show the thermal expansion coefficients for a
range of \cmos compatible materials---the majority of those used in \mems
manufacture.

            \hspace{0.5em}Titanium        & \ce{Ti}    & 8.6e-6 \\

            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
    \end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

By layering \ce{Au} ontop of \ce{Si3N4} ontop of \ce{SiO2} 
(\ce{Au}--\ce{Si3N4}--\ce{SiO2}), Scott was able to design a multimorph 
cantilever with  increasing temperature expansion coefficients and two
boundaries where the  internal stresses of each layer interacted. The cantilever 
to deflected increasingly downwards with temperature.

The \ce{Au} multimorph layer was an easily accessible electrode. However, two
electrodes are required to read the capacitance developed through a flexible
dielectric---air and in this case.  A conductive \ce{Si} substrate acted as a 
fixed electrode on the other side of the air gap, providing mechanical stability 
during operation and fabrication. The oxide layers insulated the moving \ce{Au} 
electrode from the fixed \ce{Si} substrate.

A practical implementation of a multimorph capcitive temperature sensor at least
two layers: a conductive metal contact ontop of one or more insulating oxides.
The cantilever must be mounted ontop of a conductive substrate so the potential
may be measured at both sides of the varying air gap.

\section{Modelling}

The model used and varied in the following experiments was based on the 
\ce{Au}--\ce{Si3N4}--\ce{SiO2} sensor proposed by Scott~\cite{scott2012600}.

\subsection{Geometry}

In \fem computation there is a trade-off between computation time and accuracy,
where computation time and normally accuracy increase with the number of degrees
of freedom. However, techniques can be applied to reduce degrees of freedom
without affecting accuracy. Figure~\ref{fig:model-symmetry} illustrates the
sensor geometry modelled and the lines where the two symmetry planes intersect
external faces.

Rather than mesh the entire geometry, only one of the four symmetric quadrants
was modelled, with symmetric boundary conditions applied to those intersecting
the symmetry planes. The total capacitance of the four parallel quadrants was
then found by multiplying all evaluated readings by four as 
in~\eqref{eq:C-parallel}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-parallel}
    C_{||} = \sum_{i}^4{C_i} = 4C
\end{equation}

parameters of the \comsol model.

The model was designed with a thick wafer to provide significant stability. In
reality silicon wafers range from \SIrange{200}{300}{\milli\meter}. Here the
substrate was \SI{200}{\micro\meter} thick prior to removing material for the
air gap. An air gap was left in the model so the electric potential could be meshed and simulated.

The sensor was modelled with a margin of \SI{20}{\micro\meter} to determine the 

\subsection{Mesh}

The cuboid nature of the model called for a mapped swept mesh with the greatest
mesh density in cantilever and air gap.
