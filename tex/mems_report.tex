    \begin{abstract}
        This report describes how the $C$--$T$ characteristics of \mems
        multimorph capacitive temperature sensors vary with geometry, material
        choice and thermal-annealing temperature. The sensors were modelled
        using \fem and physics simulation software---\ComsolMultiphysics---so
        the key design choices for the model and mesh are also included.
